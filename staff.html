			<h2>Xavier Cho</h2>
			<h3 style="margin-top: -15px; margin-bottom: -5px;">Security Analyst, Good Luck Charm</h3>
			<p class="description">One day, Banky unsurprisingly ate a Tide pod and was declared dead in the hospital for 15 minutes.  During his short death, Banky had a short trip to Heaven where he spoke to some higher powers.  These higher powers told him, "Banky, we have sent an angel down to Earth who might just be able to save your failure of a company."  And thus, it is then that Banky sought out Xavier, where he was found walking an elder woman across the street on his way to the local soup kitchen.</p>

			<h2>Rory Main</h2>
			<h3 style="margin-top: -15px; margin-bottom: -5px;">Full Stack Developer, Meme Lord Supreme</h3>
			<p class="description">During an extensive review by the BBB, the company was accused of racism for having no employees that <i>were not</i> Asian.  Luckily, Rory was found while an employee happened to pass by him on the street and ask what day it was.  It was Wednesday, by the way (my dude).  Now, Rory is the star developer that takes care of whatever needs to be done, and finds ingenius ways to sneak Nicholas Cage into all of his solutions.</p>

			<h2>Marianne Estrella</h2>
			<h3 style="margin-top: -15px; margin-bottom: -5px;">Office Mother</h3>
			<p class="description">Although not a coder, Marianne has probably the most important role in the company.  Throughout the daily crying and struggles over how to use a microwave in the office, without Marianne, none of the employees would be able to function at all.  In her spare time, Marianne likes to go to the local duck pond and pretend she is one of them.</p>
